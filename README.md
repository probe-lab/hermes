### CLI Arguments

We use dot notation to namespace command line arguments instead of hyphens because [the CLI library](https://github.com/urfave/cli) allows
to configuration parameters from a file which will then resolve the command line parameters. For example,
the CLI flag `--log.format` could be read from a yaml file that looks like this:

```yaml
log:
  format: json
```

_However_, Hermes currently doesn't support loading CLI arguments from a file ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

## Deployment

Depending on the network you want to trace Hermes requires auxiliary infrastructure.
As of `2024-03-27`, Hermes supports these networks:

- [Ethereum](#ethereum)

### General

There are different ways of keeping track of the events that Hermes generates:
- [AWS Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/). We're using our [own producer library](https://github.com/dennis-tra/go-kinesis) to do that.
    - In order to hook up Hermes with AWS Kinesis you need to provide the following command line flags:
        - `--data.stream.type="kinesis"`
        - `--kinesis.region=us-east-1` # just an example
        - `--kinesis.stream=$YOUR_DATA_STREAM_NAME`
    - If the name is set, Hermes will start pumping events to that stream.

> It's important to note that the events **will not** be strictly ordered. They will only follow a lose ordering. The reasons are 1) potential retries of event submissions and 2) [record aggregation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-kpl-concepts.html#kinesis-kpl-concepts-aggretation). Depending on the configured number of submission retries the events should be ordered within each 30s time window.
- [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Hermes will batch the traces, format them into a parquet file, and submit them to the given S3 Bucket. These are the flags that should be provided:
    - `--data.stream.type="s3"`
    - `--s3.region="us-east-1"` # just an example
    - `--s3.endpoint=""` # only for local testing
    - `--s3.bucket=$YOUR_S3_BUCKET_KEY`
    - `--s3.tag="hermes"` # preferred bucket key used to reference the traces
    - `--s3.byte.limit=1269760` # 10MB is the default
    - `--s3.flushers=2` # 2 is the default
    - `--s3.flush.interval="2s"` # 2s is the default
    - `--aws.key.id=$YOUR_AWS_KEY_ID` # only necessary for private buckets
    - `--aws.secret.key=$YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY` # only necessary for private buckets


- `Code Callbacks`. Hermes will execute the given callback functions whenever an event is traced.
    - `--data.stream.type="callback"`
- `Logger`. Hermes will print the JSON formatted traces into `stdout` in a log format (ideal for local testing).
    - `--data.strea.type="logger"`

_Note: we provide a local s3 setup to use if needed. The configuration of the `localstack s3` instance can be tunned using a copy (`.env`) of the `.env.template` file, which will be read by default when doing `docker compose up s3`. Make sure that the docker container is up running when launching the `hermes` instance._

### Ethereum

In order to run Hermes in the Ethereum network you are required to run a Prysm beacon node. Hermes requires Prysm over other implementations because as far as [I](https://github.com/dennis-tra) know it's the only implementation that allows dynamic registration of trusted peers. For example, Lighthouse requires the list of trusted peers at boot time.

Further, Hermes requires beacon node in general because it delegates certain requests to it. In the case of the Ethereum network Hermes forwards all requests for the following protocols:

- `/eth2/beacon_chain/req/beacon_blocks_by_range/2/ssz_snappy`
- `/eth2/beacon_chain/req/beacon_blocks_by_root/2/ssz_snappy`
- `/eth2/beacon_chain/req/blob_sidecars_by_range/1/ssz_snappy`
- `/eth2/beacon_chain/req/blob_sidecars_by_root/1/ssz_snappy`

These request handlers require knowledge of the chain state wherefore Hermes cannot handle them itself. Still, they are required to be a good citizen of the network and not get pruned by other peers.

#### Subnet Configuration

Hermes supports configuring which subnets to subscribe to for each topic type (attestation, sync committee, and blob sidecar). This can be useful to:
- Reduce resource usage by subscribing to fewer subnets
- Target specific subnets for analysis
- Distribute monitoring across multiple Hermes instances

When creating a Node, you can configure the subnets using the `SubnetConfigs` field:

```go
// Create a configuration map for different subnet topics
cfg.SubnetConfigs = map[string]*eth.SubnetConfig{
    // Subscribe to specific attestation subnets
    p2p.GossipAttestationMessage: {
        Type: eth.SubnetStatic,
        Subnets: []uint64{0, 1, 5, 44},
    },
    
    // Subscribe to all sync committee subnets (this is the default if no config provided)
    p2p.GossipSyncCommitteeMessage: {
        Type: eth.SubnetAll,
    },
    
    // Subscribe to a random set of blob sidecar subnets
    p2p.GossipBlobSidecarMessage: {
        Type: eth.SubnetRandom,
        Count: 2,
    },
}
```

For each topic that supports subnets, you can use one of these configuration strategies:

1. **Subscribe to all subnets** (default if no config provided)
   ```go
   topicConfig := &eth.SubnetConfig{
       Type: eth.SubnetAll,
   }
   ```

2. **Subscribe to specific subnets**
   ```go
   topicConfig := &eth.SubnetConfig{
       Type: eth.SubnetStatic,
       Subnets: []uint64{0, 1, 5, 44},
   }
   ```

3. **Subscribe to a random set of subnets**
   ```go
   topicConfig := &eth.SubnetConfig{
       Type: eth.SubnetRandom,
       Count: 8, // Number of subnets to randomly select
   }
   ```

4. **Subscribe to a range of subnets**
   ```go
   topicConfig := &eth.SubnetConfig{
       Type: eth.SubnetStaticRange,
       Start: 0,
       End: 32, // End is exclusive
   }
   ```

This configuration allows you to set up multiple Hermes instances that monitor different parts of the network, or to focus monitoring on specific subnets of interest.

To run Hermes for the Ethereum network you would need to point it to the beacon node by providing the

- `--local.trusted.address=true` # when the Prysm node is running in the same machine (localhost)
- `--prysm.host=1.2.3.4`
- `--prysm.port.http=3500` # 3500 is the default
- `--prysm.port.grpc=4000` # 4000 is the default

If your Prysm node requires basic authentication, you can include the credentials in the host parameter:
- `--prysm.host=username:password@1.2.3.4`

If your password contains special characters, make sure to URL encode them:
- `--prysm.host=username:my%40special%3Apass@1.2.3.4` # for password 'my@special:pass'

command line flags to the `hermes ethereum` subcommand. Check out the help page via `hermes ethereum --help` for configuration options of the libp2p host or devp2p local node (e.g., listen addrs/ports).

## Telemetry

### Metrics

When you provide the `--metrics` command line flag Hermes will expose a Prometheus HTTP endpoint at `localhost:6060`. Host and port are configurable via `--metrics.addr` and `--metrics.port`.

### Tracing

Run an OpenTelemetry Collector compatible trace collector like Jaeger:

```shell
docker run --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  --rm jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.54
```

You can find the UI at [`http://localhost:16686`](http://localhost:16686). Port `4317` is used by Hermes to export traces to.

Run Hermes with the `--tracing` flag. To change the address of the trace collector, you can also specify `--tracing.addr` and `--tracing.port`.

## Differences with other tools
Hermes jumps to the web3/blockchain/libp2p ecosystem despite a large variety of tools around it, such as the many existing network crawlers or light clients for most mature networks. Although at first sight it might look like a competitor to those, there was still a large incentive to develop it. Here, we describe the gap that Hermes fills as well as the use-cases that it is suitable for.
Hermes was designed to behave as a light node in each supported network, where, in addition to being an honest participant in the network and supporting all the protocols and RPC endpoints, it also allows streaming of custom internal events (mostly libp2p-related).

Hermes avoids being based on a custom fork of existing full/light clients, which would come with non-negligible maintenance baggage and would complicate having control of events.

Currently available similar tools:

### Armiarma Crawler from MigaLabs vs Hermes from ProbeLab
Although both Hermes and Armiarma seem to be focusing on the same goals at first sight, they have significant differences in their use cases and their targets in data collection and metrics.

[Armiarma](https://github.com/migalabs/armiarma) is a network crawler that relies on running discv5 peer discovery service and a libp2p host 24/7 to establish connections. However, significant modifications have been made to connect to as many peers as possible (custom peering module). This way, it tries to identify as many peers as possible in the network periodically. Thus, its focus is mainly on opening and identifying as many peers as possible, rather than maintaining stable connections to other peers in the network.

On the other hand, although Hermes also relies on a continuously running discv5 and libp2p host, it uses the libp2p connection manager for a different purpose to Armiarma (which is to connect to as many peers as possible). In the case of Hermes, the connection manager is used to decide who it connects to (i.e., simulating the behaviour of a standard node). Furthermore, it backs up some of the RPC, which requires keeping the chain db calls on a trusted node. This way, it behaves like a light node to the network, which is honest and beneficial for the rest of the network, allowing us to track all desired networking events from stable connections, while at the same time having a highly customizable tracing system.
